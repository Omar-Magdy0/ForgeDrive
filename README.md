## 🧠 Overview

ForgeDriveMC implements **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)** and **Self-Commissioning (SComm)** for PMSM drives with a clean hardware abstraction layer (`eldriver`) that runs identically on:

| Platform | Purpose | Toolchain |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Host (x86)** | SIL simulation, HIL testing, GUI dashboard | Native GCC + CMake |
| **STM32F4** | Embedded deployment | GCC ARM Embedded + CMake |

### Core Capabilities

- ⚙️ **FOC** (Field-Oriented Control) with SVM
- 🔬 **SComm** (Self-Commissioning) — HFI-based parameter identification
- 📊 **Real-time Dashboard** — ImGui/ImPlot GUI with scope, triggers, and analytics
- 🧪 **SIL Simulation** — Full PMSM electrical model with HDF5 logging
- 🔄 **ABF Protocol** — Asynchronous Binary Frame over USB-CDC/UART/TCP
- 📈 **DAQ System** — Internal Data Value (IDV) serialization for telemetry

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Project Structure

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `application/` | Main entry, PMSM control logic |
| `application/PmsmControl/` | FOC, SComm, position drivers, types |
| `core/` | Low-level utilities (rstream, smem, math) |
| `middleware/` | ABF/IDV protocols, DAQ, scope stream |
| `platform/host/` | Host eldrivers, SIL engine, GUI |
| `platform/stm32f4/` | STM32F4 HAL, USB, FreeRTOS config |
| `ForgeTool/` | PC utility for USB communication |
| `test/` | SIL integration tests |

---

## 🎮 Control Modes

| Mode | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `Foc` | Field-Oriented Control with Space Vector PWM | ✅ Active |
| `SComm` | Self-Commissioning (R, Ld, Lq identification via HFI) | ✅ Active |
| `Idle` | Safe state, motor disabled | ✅ Active |

### Control Loop Architecture

```
pwmLoop() ─── PWM rate (e.g., 25 kHz)
  ├── Read ADC (phase currents, bus voltage)
  ├── Clarke/Park transforms
  ├── Current PI controllers (dq frame)
  ├── Inverse Park/Clarke
  └── Write SVM duty cycles

xmcLoop() ─── Slow loop (~1 kHz)
  ├── Position/speed estimation
  ├── Speed/position PI controllers
  └── Setpoint management
```

---

## 🔬 SIL Simulation

The Software-in-the-Loop engine models:

- **PMSM electrical dynamics** — saliency, mutual inductances, back-EMF
- **Inverter non-idealities** — dead-time, diode commutation, on/off resistance
- **Discontinuity handling** — sub-stepping for drive transitions
- **HDF5 logging** — compressed, chunked datasets with column metadata

Launch the GUI dashboard:
```bash
./build/bin/ForgeDriveMC
```

---

## 📡 Communication Protocols

### ABF (Asynchronous Binary Frame)
- Sync byte + ServiceID + Payload + CRC-8 AUTOSAR
- MCOBS encoding for payload
- Supports UART, USB-CDC, and TCP transports

### IDV (Internal Data Value)
- Self-describing serialization for DAQ channels
- Auto-discovery with MARKER-based session/stream/channel hierarchy
